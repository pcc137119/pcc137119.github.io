<h1>Why Mark Zuckerberg is definitely a shapeshifting lizard person</h1>

He has been known to answer in a weird way when asked if he was indeed a lizard. He’s a lizard because he was born into a lizard family in sweet home Alabama where his mom was also his sister. They lived underground in the sewer beneath the haunted Drish House in Tuscaloosa. He had a rough childhood when his sister started snorting meth, so her mom killed her and cooked her for dinner. After that meal they all started to evolve into shape shifting lizards. And that kids, is how the Mark Zuckerberg we know now was born.
